              There are plenty of places to go on the Internet to learn, practice, share and discover more about code, and quite often
              we get people attending who are working their way through resources they've found elsewhere on the web. The
              following are just a few of the ones we see people on, along with some we recommend you try.

                Alexander Kallaway spent a year and a half learning to code and had many ups and downs along the way. He felt his
                experience would be useful to people and so set up #100DaysOfCode, challenging people to code for an hour a day.
                The challenge now has a small army of committed subscribers who share their projects, experiences and progress daily.

            <p>
              Are you interested in what life was like when computers were programmed using 4-letter code words and hexadecimal 
              numbers? Well, wonder no more. Box-256 is a computer game that challenges you to draw shapes using the kind of 
              limited instruction set last seen in the 1960s. Challenging and interesting, even for the most prolific coder.

            <p>
              Whether you're writing your first line of code or transforming your career, Codecademy is a great place to start
              and get the technical skills you need to skill up and stand out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Courses range from individual languages to so-called 'Intensive Programs' that teach specific software development
              techniques and tasks, from building web sites and APIs from scratch right through to data visualisation.

            <p>
              Code Combat was designed for use in schools but is a great place to start if you're looking to jump straight in. You are
              guided through steps such that you end up designing and implementing the artificial intelligence for a character
              in a computer game. All the graphics are done for you, so you just have to write a few lines of object-oriented
              Python code to get going.

            <p>
              The principle behind Code Wars is that you achieve mastery through challenge, and you can improve your skills by training
              with others. The exercises are real code challenges and can be done in any of 20 different languages. Users
              are encouraged to share and discuss their answers, meaning there's always someone to ask and always some way
              to learn.

              A site where you can practice coding in almost any language you can think of. It has a beautiful interface, solo and user-versus-user
              challenges, competitions, badges, a rating system and lots more besides. Challenges range in difficulty from
              relatively simple to PhD-level, so there's something for everyone.
